# .github Repository

Welcome to the `.github` repository! This is a special repository within our GitHub organization that serves as the default community health file for all repositories under our organization's umbrella.

## What is a `.github` Repository?

A `.github` repository is used to provide default community health files for any public repository in our organization that does not contain its own file of that type.

### Features

- **Issue Templates**: Issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and more to help contributors provide the necessary information when submitting issues.
- **Pull Request Template**: A default template for all pull requests to guide contributors through the process.
- **Code of Conduct**: Our pledge to a harassment-free experience for everyone, laying out the standards of behavior for our community.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Instructions and guidelines on how to contribute to our projects effectively.

## How It Works

If a repository does not contain its own community health files, it will inherit those from this `.github` repository.

For example:
- If `Repo-A` does not have a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, it will use the one from this `.github` repository.
- If `Repo-B` has its own `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, it will override the default provided here.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to improve our community health files. If you have suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request or an issue.

Thank you for being a part of our organization and for contributing to a positive and inclusive environment.
